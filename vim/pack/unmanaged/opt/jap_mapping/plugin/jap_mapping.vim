				     " may use less disk space if you use only "alphabetic" scripts such as Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew or Arabic, and
				     " not "ideographic" scripts like Chinese, Japanese or Korean. With the ucs encodings it is usually better
"set bomb                             " to also set 'bomb' on ('byte-order-mark" option, irrelevant for utf-8 but not for ucs)

"In "replace" mode, one utf character (one or more data bytes) replaces one utf character (which need not use the same number of bytes)
"In "normal" mode, ga shows the character under the cursor as text, decimal, octal and hex; g8 shows which byte(s) is/are used to represent it
"In "insert" or "replace" mode,
"	 - any character defined on your keyboard can be entered the usual way (even with dead keys if you have them, e.g. Ã¢ÃªÃ®Ã´Ã»  Ã¤Ã«Ã¯Ã¶Ã¼)
"	 - any character which has a "digraph" (there are a huge lot of them, see :dig after setting enc=utf-8) can be entered with a Ctrl-K prefix
"	 - any utf character at all can be entered with a Ctrl-V prefix, either <Ctrl-V> u aaaa or <Ctrl-V> U bbbbbbbb, with 0 <= aaaa <= FFFF, or 0 <= bbbbbbbb <= 7FFFFFFF

"	Unicode can be used to create html "body text", at least for Netscape 6 and probably for IE; but on my machine it doesn't display properly as "title text" (i.e., between <title></title> tags in the <head> part).

"	Gvim will display it properly if you have the fonts for it, provided that you set 'guifont' to some fixed-width font which has the glyphs you want to use (Courier New is OK for French, German, Greek, Russian and more, but I'm not sure about Hebrew or Arabic; its glyphs are of a more "fixed" width than those of, e.g. Lucida Console: the latter can be annoying if you need bold Cyrillic writing).
